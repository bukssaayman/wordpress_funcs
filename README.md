# Usefull WordPress Snippets
This is a collection of WP snippets that I regularly use.

- add_no_referrer.php - You can read more about why this is useful here : [https://bukssaayman.co.za/fixing_target_blank/](https://bukssaayman.co.za/fixing_target_blank/)

- debug_404.php - This helps debug any 404 errors on your site.

- post-tax-hierarchy.php - This is still a work in progress. I built this for a previous employer to add taxonomy terms in the URL. I will eventually convert this to a plugin.
